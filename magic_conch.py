Magic conch discord bot
Created by Bartosz Kosakowski
Idea credit goes to my friend Caroline 

Once the bot is on the discord server, ask it a question by 
calling "!magic_conch, <question>". It will provide respond
with "yes", "no", "probably", "probably not", "maybe", or 
"maybe some day" and other bs.
